description: "When Farzaneh Noori learned in November of 2009 that she had breast cancer, she was, like most people who get that news, shaken and unprepared. Not only did she have a healthy lifestyle that included daily exercise, meditation and a wholesome diet, she was the co-owner of a yoga studio, downtown Pasadena's popular Yoga House."
